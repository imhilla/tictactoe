## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a game that you can play in your browser. It involves two players taking turns while filling in cells to
fit a winning combination.

This project is meant to demonstrate mastery of javascript factory functions and use of modules while making sure we have minimal global code.

We create modules for example the players module and an IIFE. We added features that displays, updates, hides the board. Also, we were able to show names of players names whenever one is required to paly. We cleaned up the interface to allow players to put in their names, included a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!
